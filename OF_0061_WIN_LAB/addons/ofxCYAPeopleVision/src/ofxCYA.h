 ofxCYAPeopleVision is a tool for sensing people in spaces.
 
 CYA People Vision Software is a cross platform set of video sensing tools developed 
 in Openframeworks (http://www.openframeworks.cc) for use in design, prototyping, 
 and installed systems.
 
 A collaboration started by LAB at Rockwell Group (http://lab.rockwellgroup.com ) 
 and the LABS at IDEO (http://labs.ideo.com). Join Us!
 
 This started as an initiative between Dave Vondle and Joshua Walton with many of 
 the key components generated through the hard work of James Tichenor, Brett Renfer, 
 and James George who in turn also used components from the openframeworks community 
 who in turn built upon many open source projects.
